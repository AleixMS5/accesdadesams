    <p>Deep in the Caribbean lies Melee Island, ruled by the governor Elaine Marley. The cruel pirate
            LeChuck is deeply in love with her - so deeply that he refuses to accept his own death. As a ghost, he
            dwells with his undead crew somewhere near the mysterious Monkey Island. Meanwhile, a young fellow named
            Guybrush Threepwood is determined to become a real pirate. At the Scumm Bar, he meets three pirates who tell
            him he has to complete three difficult tasks in order to be worthy of this title. But as Guybrush is trying
            to complete these tasks, he encounters the lovely governor, and this meeting changes his life forever.
            Risking to incur the wrath of LeChuck, Guybrush has to prove his wit is as sharp as his sword, and figure
            out a way to foil the ghost pirate's plans.</p>

    <p>Konami's long-running series of Castlevania games makes its debut on the N64. The traditional 2D
            graphics have been left behind; this is the first Castlevania game in 3D. However, the goal of the game
            remains the same: kick some vampire butt as you battle the evil Count Dracula and his minions in this
            platformer.</p>

    <p>Long ago, before humans existed, the world was ruled by dragons. However, when humans came along,
            the dragons were all but wiped out thanks to the Four Lords, mighty god-like beings who defeated them in an
            epic battle. The Age of Fire began, a golden age for humanity, but such prosperity could not last. A curious
            affliction has started to appear: called the Darksign, those it brands are cursed to become an immortal
            undead, forever returning from death until they ultimately lose their minds. It is said that one day, a
            Chosen Undead will appear, and a great change will occur in the world. One of the many undead manages to
            escape the asylum he was locked in, which is seen as the first sign for the role he will eventually play.</p>

            events led to the exile of King Vendrick, and the land became desolate, with lost souls dwelling in it.
            Meanwhile, a lone traveler is seen near the village of Majula. He is trying to find a cure for a terrible
            curse that has fallen upon him, forcing him to lose his humanity and prey upon the souls of the dark beings.
            An enigmatic woman known as the Emerald Herald tells him that the Four Grand Souls have to be collected in
            order to bring redemption to the traveler and the entire land of Drangleic.</p>
