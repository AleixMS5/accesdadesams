            LeChuck is deeply in love with her - so deeply that he refuses to accept his own death. As a ghost, he

            Guybrush Threepwood is determined to become a real pirate. At the Scumm Bar, he meets three pirates who tell

        <description>Konami's long-running series of Castlevania games makes its debut on the N64. The traditional 2D
            graphics have been left behind; this is the first Castlevania game in 3D. However, the goal of the game
            remains the same: kick some vampire butt as you battle the evil Count Dracula and his minions in this
            platformer.

        <description>Long ago, before humans existed, the world was ruled by dragons. However, when humans came along,
            the dragons were all but wiped out thanks to the Four Lords, mighty god-like beings who defeated them in an
            epic battle. The Age of Fire began, a golden age for humanity, but such prosperity could not last. A curious
            affliction has started to appear: called the Darksign, those it brands are cursed to become an immortal
            undead, forever returning from death until they ultimately lose their minds. It is said that one day, a
            Chosen Undead will appear, and a great change will occur in the world. One of the many undead manages to
            escape the asylum he was locked in, which is seen as the first sign for the role he will eventually play.
