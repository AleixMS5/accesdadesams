        <description>Deep in the Caribbean lies Melee Island, ruled by the governor Elaine Marley. The cruel pirate
            LeChuck is deeply in love with her - so deeply that he refuses to accept his own death. As a ghost, he
            dwells with his undead crew somewhere near the mysterious Monkey Island. Meanwhile, a young fellow named
            Guybrush Threepwood is determined to become a real pirate. At the Scumm Bar, he meets three pirates who tell
            him he has to complete three difficult tasks in order to be worthy of this title. But as Guybrush is trying
            to complete these tasks, he encounters the lovely governor, and this meeting changes his life forever.
            Risking to incur the wrath of LeChuck, Guybrush has to prove his wit is as sharp as his sword, and figure
            out a way to foil the ghost pirate's plans.

        <description>Konami's long-running series of Castlevania games makes its debut on the N64. The traditional 2D
            graphics have been left behind; this is the first Castlevania game in 3D. However, the goal of the game
            remains the same: kick some vampire butt as you battle the evil Count Dracula and his minions in this
            platformer.
